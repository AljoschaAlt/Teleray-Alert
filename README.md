# RAMP starting kit on the Teleray project

Go to [`ramp-worflow`](https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow) for more help on the [RAMP](http:www.ramp.studio) ecosystem.

Install ramp-workflow (rampwf), then execute

```
ramp_test_submission
```

to test the starting kit submission (`submissions/starting_kit`).

Get started on this RAMP with the [dedicated notebook](https://github.com/AljoschaAlt/Teleray-Alert/blob/master/teleray_alert_starting_kit.ipynb).
